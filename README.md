# snake-game

Followed the following YouTube tutorial from Engineer Man: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbasThWVb-c&ab_channel=EngineerMan

It was creating a Snake game in Python in under 5 minutes. 

Comments were created for each line of code for me to better understand the thought process behind it.
